Here is what we did in this branch:

- Here we consumed the `Regions` endpoint.
- Started off commenting out all `[Authorize]` attributes to ensure access to specific methods.
- Added a new controller called `RegionsController`.
- Created an empty view with the name - `Index.cshtml`.

Important Note
---
In ASP.NET Core, HttpClient is a class that enables sending HTTP requests and receiving HTTP 
responses from web servers, making it essential for consuming APIs. It allows you to interact
with web APIs, services, and resources, handling requests and responses, including parsing 
data and errors. Its importance lies in providing a flexible and customizable way to 
consume APIs, enabling your application to communicate with external services, 
retrieve data, and integrate with third-party systems, ultimately enhancing 
its functionality and capabilities.
